# Introduction

Ian Mitchell had published an excellent [Level Set Method Toolbox for MATLAB](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mitchell/ToolboxLS/), but the project seems not continued.

I built this repository to hold the code, porting the code to newer versions of MATLAB, and publishing some of my work related to the level set method.

# About the code

`README` file is the original version by Ian Mitchell, while the introduced URL to the project is now a 404 page.

The `Example` contains code to use this toolbox, and the `Kernel` directory containes the core code.

# Usage

## Run example code

Using MATLAB, `cd` to any directory under the `Example ` directory you like and run the functions. Most of the examples can be run without any parameter.

You don't have to modify the path string in `Examples\addPathToKernel.m`, as is mentioned in the original `README` file by Ian Mitchell.
